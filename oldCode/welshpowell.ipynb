#1. determine degree of each vertex
#2. order vertices from max to min (ties don't matter, decide ties however you want)
#3. color first vertex (that is the one with the highest degree) a color
#4. color each subsequent vertex not connected to that vertex or another vertex already that that color the color
#5. repeat until every vertex is colored (that is go to next highest degree vertex, assign it a color, assign all not connected (and not already colored) that color, repeat)
